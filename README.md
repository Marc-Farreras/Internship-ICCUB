# Internship-ICCUB
This repository houses the report detailing my internship at ICCUB, where the objective was to develop an application showcasing and enabling user interaction with the dynamics of the dark soliton solution in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). 

The code can be found in the following github repository: https://github.com/Marc-Farreras/Dark_solyton_dynamics/tree/master/DarkSolyton
